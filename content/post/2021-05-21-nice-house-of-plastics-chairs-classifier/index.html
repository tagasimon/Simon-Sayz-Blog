<h2>Background of App</h2>
<p>So i‚Äôve been working as a Business Systems Analyst at <a href="https://www.nice.co.ug/">Nice House of Plastics</a> for a few months now. One of my smallest challenges was to memorize the names of Our Best Selling Chairs. i.e All Size Vs Portable. It‚Äôs not a big problem but why not?</p>
<div id="solution" class="section level3">
<h3>Solution üíΩ</h3>
<p>I wanted my Solution to be Simple &amp; Fast. So i decided to work on a machine learning model and serve it through a Mobile Application. So i could always take a pic with my Phone‚Äôs Camera and get the Prediction.</p>
</div>
<div id="how" class="section level3">
<h3>How ? ‚òÑÔ∏è</h3>
<p>To train a model, you need a lot of training data, say 1000 for each chair. The obvious method would have been to take a lot of pictures on my phone and use them as training data. After taking about 10 Pics, i realized there has to be a better way:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Record a 2 Min Video of each Chair on My Phone.</li>
<li>Open the Video in Photoshop and Export each Frame of the Video as an Image</li>
<li>Use tensor flow the modeling.</li>
<li>Flutter for the Mobile Application.</li>
</ul>

<div id="anhaa" class="section level3">
<h3>Anhaa!! ü§î</h3>
<p>The Question still remains?? Does it work?</p>

</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion !</h3>
<p>Am no expert on Machine Learning and i don‚Äôt think this is the best way to do it, but it works.</p>
<p>You can also get yourself One of Our Chairs and Test this Application.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-next" class="section level3">
<h3>What Next</h3>
<p>Am thinking of training a model that can do predictions on all Our Products and may be a mini recommendation engine on Our Website.</p>
