## Background üôà of appstorr

I did some text analysis on [SafeBoda Google Play Store Reviews](https://simonsayz.xyz/post/text-analysis-of-safeboda-app-google-play-store-reviews-in-r/) and someone challenged me to work on a package around it for any company with an app to look into their reviews faster and easier, so i did!!üòÉ

### Installation üíΩ

The latest stable version (if any) could be found on [Appstorr](https://github.com/tagasimon/appstorr), and installed using devtools package.

    if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("tagasimon/appstorr")

### Usage ‚òÑÔ∏è

The package is extremely easy to use. Almost everything could be done in one line of code.

    df <- appstorr::df_safeboda
    appstorr::quick_report(data = df, 
                           report_title = "Awesome SafeBoda Text Analysis Report")

### Future Workü§†
