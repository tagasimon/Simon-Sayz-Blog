      <description>Why is NA == NA = NA?Most Objects in R compared to themselves return TRUE but no NA.It’s actually i had never thought about but thinking about it makes some alot of sense, Comparing two Unknowns shouldn’t should be return TRUE.
Let’s Look at some of the Most Common examples that return TRUE
10 == 10## [1] TRUE-10 == -10## [1] TRUEFALSE == FALSE## [1] TRUE&amp;quot;NA&amp;quot; == &amp;quot;NA&amp;quot;## [1] TRUEThis is a string “NA” and not the NA we are talking about and will return a TRUE just like any other similar string comparison</description>

      <description>How can we tell what programming languages and technologies are used by the most people? How about what languages are growing and which are shrinking, so that we can tell which are most worth investing time in?
One excellent source of data is Stack Overflow, a programming question and answer site with more than 16 million questions on programming topics. By measuring the number of questions about each technology, we can get an approximate sense of how many people are using it.</description>
