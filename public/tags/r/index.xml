For the not so die-hard fans, there are the ridiculously expensive ads that are hilarious, gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and sometimes weird. And of course, there are the halftime shows with the biggest musicians in the world entertaining us by riding a giant mechanical tiger or leaping from the roof of the stadium.</description>

      <description>Why is NA == NA = NA?Most Objects in R compared to themselves return TRUE but no NA.It’s actually i had never thought about but thinking about it makes some alot of sense, Comparing two Unknowns shouldn’t be return TRUE.
Let’s Look at some of the Most Common examples that return TRUE
10 == 10## [1] TRUE-10 == -10## [1] TRUEFALSE == FALSE## [1] TRUE&amp;quot;NA&amp;quot; == &amp;quot;NA&amp;quot;## [1] TRUEThis is a string “NA” and not the NA we are talking about and will return a TRUE just like any other similar string comparison</description>
